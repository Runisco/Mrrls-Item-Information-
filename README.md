Displays some information in the tooltip of most items sold by Mrrl in Nazjatar.

On the items where there are no indication of what the item will actually become, this addon displays that. 
So for example if Mrrl is selling the "Faintly Humming Sea Stones", the tooltip will tell you that the item is 1x Scrying Stone.
